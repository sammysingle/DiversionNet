# DiversionNet
Research on Understanding Landfill Waste Diversion Using Convolution Neural Network Image Classification

This repository contains the DiversionNet dataset used for research to improve waste auditing practices by identifying divertible waste in images based on computer vision based on convolution neural networks. DiversionNet currently contains labels for cardboard, food, glass, plastic, paper, metal, vegetation, and trash.

DiversionNet has been assembled by collating open source datasets, with acknowledgements to:
